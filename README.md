The PuppyPi Sulky project was initiated by the ENGG 160 Instructional Team at the University of Alberta as part of the Intro to Engineering Design course. The project was developed to provide students with hands-on experience in mechanical design, prototyping, teamwork, and engineering problem-solving.

This project is the University of Alberta ENGG 160 puppypi sulky final design. The project aims to design and prototype a lightweight, functional sulky that can securely hold and transport a beaker of water across a defined distance with minimal spillage. The sulky must meet the performance and functional requirements outlined in the original project proposal.

Key stakeholders include the ENGG 160 instructional team, the student design teams, and the broader engineering faculty. The success of the project impacts students' learning experiences and contributes to the course's educational objectives.
